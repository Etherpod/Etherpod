- Hey, I’m @Etherpod!
- I have some experience with Unity, C# programming, 3D modeling, and sound design.
- I've also been working on modding Unity games, mainly Outer Wilds. Check out the game and the unofficial Discord modding server for it!
- If you want to reach out to me, use [etherpod@gmail.com].
